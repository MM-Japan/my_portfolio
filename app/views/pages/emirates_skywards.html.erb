        <p class="lead text-muted mb-4">
          Developed a branded Unity game experience for Emirates Skywards, designed for use at promotional events on tablet devices.
          The suite features three interactive mini-games â€” a Runner where players pilot a plane through obstacles, a Hat Swap memory game,
          and a Spin the Wheel token game. Each session culminates in a tiered quiz stage, with questions tailored to the tokens collected.
          Built with Unity and PlayFab integration, the project included attract and login screens, dynamic UI flows, sound design,
          animation, and gameplay scripting.
        </p>
        <p class="text-muted">
          Alongside the booth game, created a standalone Unity companion app that enables Emirates staff to easily update and manage quiz
          questions in real time through PlayFab. This tool streamlined client control over content without requiring developer intervention,
          ensuring flexibility for events and future updates.
